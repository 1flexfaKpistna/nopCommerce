# How to Use Virtual Audio Cable Full Version to Transfer Audio Streams Between Applications
  
Virtual Audio Cable (VAC) is a software that allows you to transfer audio streams between applications or devices. It creates a set of virtual audio devices named "Virtual Cables," each of them consisting of a pair of waveform input/output devices. Any application can send an audio stream to an output side of a cable, and any other application can receive this stream from an input side. All transfers are made digitally, providing no sound quality loss (a bit-perfect streaming).

In this article, we will show you how to use Virtual Audio Cable Full Version to connect different audio applications and devices on your Windows or macOS system. You will learn how to download, install, configure, and use VAC for various audio scenarios.
  
## Download and Install Virtual Audio Cable Full Version
  
The first step is to download and install Virtual Audio Cable Full Version on your computer. You can get it from the official website[^1^] [^3^] or from other trusted sources[^2^]. The full version of VAC offers more features and options than the Lite version, such as up to 256 virtual cable devices, RTAudio support, signal mixing, PCM format conversion, volume control, channel scattering/gathering mode, watermark control technique, stream buffering technique, Control Panel application, and Audio Repeater application.
  
The installation process is simple and straightforward. Just extract the ZIP file and run the setup program in administrator mode. Then follow the instructions on the screen and reboot your computer after installation. You will see a new icon in your system tray that indicates VAC is running.
  
## Configure Virtual Audio Cable Full Version
  
The next step is to configure Virtual Audio Cable Full Version according to your needs and preferences. You can access the Control Panel application by right-clicking on the system tray icon and selecting "Control Panel." Here you can see the list of virtual cable devices and their properties, such as number of channels, sampling rate, bits per sample, stream format, buffer size, etc. You can also create new virtual cable devices or delete existing ones by clicking on the "+" or "-" buttons.
  
To change the properties of a virtual cable device, double-click on its name or click on the "Set" button. A new window will open where you can adjust various parameters, such as cable name, number of cables in a set (for channel scattering/gathering mode), internal latency (buffer size), stream format (PCM or RTAudio), sampling rate (from 8000 Hz to 384000 Hz), bits per sample (from 8 to 32), number of channels (from 1 to 32), volume control (both attenuation and boost), channel mapping (for channel scattering/gathering mode), etc. You can also enable or disable watermark control technique and stream buffering technique for each cable device.
  
After you have configured your virtual cable devices, click on the "OK" button to save your changes and close the window. You can also click on the "Reset" button to restore default settings or on the "Cancel" button to discard your changes and close the window.
  
## Use Virtual Audio Cable Full Version
  
The final step is to use Virtual Audio Cable Full Version to transfer audio streams between applications or devices. To do this, you need to select the appropriate virtual cable device as the input or output device in your audio applications or devices. For example, if you want to record the sound from a media player application using an audio recorder application, you need to select the same virtual cable device as the output device in the media player application and as the input device in the audio recorder application. Then you can start playing the media file in the media player application and start recording it in the audio recorder application.
  
You can also use Virtual Audio Cable Full Version to connect multiple applications or devices together using different virtual cable devices. For example, if you want to mix the sound from two media player applications using an audio mixer application, you need to select different virtual cable devices as the output devices in each media player application and as the input devices in the audio mixer application. Then you can start playing different media files in each media player application and start mixing them in the audio mixer application.
  
Another useful feature of Virtual Audio Cable Full Version is the Audio Repeater
